# **Buzzats - Connecting Comsats University Students**
## **Overview**
Buzzats is a socializing mobile application designed to foster connections among students enrolled at Comsats University Islamabad, Lahore campus. The application serves as a multifunctional platform, enabling students to interact, access timetables, check room availability, and seek assistance with campus-related challenges. Buzzats aims to bridge the gap between students and campus life by facilitating communication and information sharing.

## **Features**
### Chats: 
Connect with fellow students through chat functionality, promoting communication and collaboration among users.

### Timetable: 
Access your class schedule directly within the app, making it easier to stay organized and plan your day.

### Room Availability: 
Check room availability in each campus block, helping you find study spaces and meeting locations conveniently.

### Academic Assistance: 
Interact with students from different batches and sections to seek guidance on elective course selection, semester projects, and other academic matters.

## Technology Stack
### Front-end: 
We have chosen the Flutter framework based on Dart for the front-end development. Flutter's object-oriented programming (OOP) structure allows us to compile natively for Android, iOS, and the web with a single codebase, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

### Back-end: 
To establish a fast and reliable connection between our database and the front end, we employ a Socket connection using a Node.js server. The Node.js server is hosted remotely on a cloud service to ensure 24/7 availability.

### Database: 
For our database needs, we rely on Microsoft SQL Server, which is hosted remotely on Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. This choice ensures data integrity and accessibility, supporting the seamless operation of Buzzats.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of Buzzats is to provide exposure to Fresh Year and Sophomore Year students, acquainting them with the various activities and opportunities available within the university. By connecting students and facilitating communication, we aim to empower them to make the most of their time on campus.\
